# Quantum Density Matrix Word Embeddings
Python implementation of my master thesis 'Density Matrix Methods in Quantum Natural Language Processing': https://doi.org/10.48693/111
It trains density matrices as word embeddings from a given small text corpus using a quantum neural network ande valuate word similarity of the trained word embeddings.


## Getting started
virtualenv venv ==python==python3.8
pip install -r requirements.txt
